### Finance Industry — Understanding the Problem of **Bank of America Consumer Complaints Analysis**

---

##  1. Business Problem

**Overview:**
Bank of America (BoA), one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, has been experiencing a **high volume of consumer complaints** across its major financial products and services — including **credit cards, loans, mortgages, and deposit accounts**.

These complaints, submitted to the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** between **2017 and 2023**, highlight recurring issues around **product quality, service responsiveness, and customer communication**.

**Key Challenges:**

* Rising complaints indicate weaknesses in **customer experience management**, **operational efficiency**, and **regulatory compliance**.
* These issues threaten the bank’s **reputation, customer trust, and market competitiveness**.
* Despite having grievance management systems, the bank lacks **data-driven insights** into complaint patterns and response performance.

**Core Gaps Identified:**

* Which products or services generate the highest dissatisfaction.
* The most frequent and recurring issues reported by customers.
* The effectiveness of complaint channels (web, phone, email, mail, etc.).
* How quickly and effectively complaints are resolved.
* How response timeliness impacts customer satisfaction and compliance.

Without these insights, leadership and operations teams struggle to identify **root causes**, **prioritize service improvements**, and **address compliance risks** proactively.

**Objective:**
To transition from a **reactive** to a **proactive, analytics-driven complaint management strategy** that leverages consumer complaint data to uncover actionable insights.

**Goals:**
This project aims to:

* Identify the **most problematic products, issues, and regions**.
* Measure **response efficiency** and **resolution quality**.
* Understand **customer satisfaction drivers**.
* Support **strategic decision-making** that enhances service delivery, compliance, and long-term customer retention.
